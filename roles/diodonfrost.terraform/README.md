## Example Playbook

This is a sample playbook file for deploying the Ansible Galaxy terraform role in a localhost and installing the latest version of Terraform.

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: diodonfrost.terraform
```

This role can also install a specific version of terraform.

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-terraform
      vars:
        - terraform_version: 0.12.0-rc1

```

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-terraform
      vars:
        - terraform_version: 0.11.14

```

## Local Testing

The preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker. You will have to install Docker on your system.

You can also use Virtualbox with kitchen-vagrant to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and terraform on your system. For all our tests we use test-kitchen.

Next install test-kitchen:

```shell
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Testing with Docker

```shell
# List all tests with kitchen
kitchen list

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test terraform-latest-centos-7

# test on all machines
kitchen test

# for development, create environment
kitchen create terraform-latest-centos-7

# Apply ansible playbook
kitchen converge terraform-latest-centos-7

# Apply inspec tests
kitchen verify terraform-latest-centos-7
```

### Testing with Virtualbox

```shell
# Specify kitchen file on Linux
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-vagrant.yml

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test terraform-latest-centos-7
```

### Testing on Windows with Virtualbox

Windows can only be test with Virtualbox provider, do not use 'kitchen test' command for testing Windows environment. There 4 steps you will be using with test-kitchen as part of your workflow.

First of all we must set the kitchen file:
```shell
# For testing Windows
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-windows.yml
```

Provision the virtual machines, a Linux machine to run Ansible and Windows machines to apply playbook again:
```shell
# deploy machines
kitchen create

# Launch playbook
kitchen converge
```

Finaly launch inspec tests:
```shell
kitchen verify
```

For cleaning environment use:
```shell
kitchen destroy
```
